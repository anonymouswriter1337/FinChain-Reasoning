This can be calculated using the formula: Required Yield = Face Value / (Coupon Amount / 100). In this case, the required yield is 2.80%.\n\nStep 2: Determine the bond's price by subtracting the required yield from the face value.

The given information states that the VaR is 10.7% higher than before, which means that the portfolio value has increased by 10.7% since the last assessment. To calculate the new VaR, we need to know the value of the portfolio. The question states that the portfolio value is $60,862, so we can plug this value into the formula:\n\nVaR = (1 - alpha) \\* ($60,862 - (1 - alpha) \\* (VaR))\n\nWe know that VaR was $62,500 before, so we can plug this value into the formula:\n\nVaR = (1 - alpha) \\* ($60,862 - (1 - alpha) \\* $62,500)\n\nNow, we need to solve for VaR. To do this, we can use the fact that VaR is a percentage, so we can divide both sides of the equation by 100 to eliminate the percentage sign. We can then solve for VaR as follows:\n\nVaR = (1 - alpha) \\* (60,862 - (1 - alpha) \\* 62,500) / 100\n\nWe know that alpha is 95%, so we can plug this value into the formula:\n\nVaR = (1 - 0.95) \\* (60,862 - (1 - 0.95) \\* 62,500) / 100\n\nNow, we can solve for VaR as follows:\n\nVaR = (0.05) \\* (60,862 - (1 - 0.05) \\* 62,500) / 100\n\nVaR = (0.05) \\* (60,862 - (0.95) \\* 62,500) / 100\n\nVaR = (0.05) \\* (60,862 - 56,250) / 100\n\nVaR = (0.05) \\* 3,882 / 100\n\nVaR = $194.11\n\nSo, the new VaR is $194.11.", "model": "financeconnect_13b"}
