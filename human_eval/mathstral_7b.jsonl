Here's a step-by-step solution:\n\nStep 1: Understand the problem.\nThe problem states that a firm's Value at Risk (VaR) is $121810, and it has a sensitivity of 1.75 to volatility changes. This means that for every 1% change in volatility, the VaR changes by 1.75%. We need to find out how the VaR changes when volatility changes by -8.87%.\n\nStep 2: Calculate the change in VaR due to volatility change.\nTo do this, we multiply the sensitivity (1.75) by the volatility change (-8.87%). The percentage sign indicates that -8.87 is a percentage, so we don't need to convert it to a decimal.\n\nChange in VaR = Sensitivity * Volatility Change\n= 1.75 * -8.87\n= -15.4575\n\nStep 3: Interpret the result.\nThe result is negative, which means the VaR will decrease. The absolute value of the result represents the amount of decrease. So, the VaR will decrease by $15,457.50 when volatility changes by -8.87%.\n\nStep 4: Calculate the new VaR.\nTo find the new VaR, we subtract the change in VaR from the original VaR.\n\nNew VaR = Original VaR - Change in VaR\n= $121810 - $15457.50\n= $106352.50\n\nSo, the new VaR after the volatility change is $106352.50.", "model": "mathstral_7b", "recall": 0.0, "precision": 0.0, "final_answer_match": 0}

We are asked to find out how the VaR changes when volatility changes by -9.67%.\n\nStep 2: Calculate the change in VaR. The change in VaR can be calculated by multiplying the sensitivity of VaR to volatility changes by the change in volatility. In this case, the sensitivity is 1.54 and the change in volatility is -9.67%. So, the change in VaR is:\n\nChange in VaR = Sensitivity * Change in Volatility\n= 1.54 * -9.67%\n= -14.86%\n\nStep 3: Calculate the new VaR. The new VaR can be calculated by subtracting the change in VaR from the original VaR. In this case, the original VaR is $113,110 and the change in VaR is -14.86%. So, the new VaR is:\n\nNew VaR = Original VaR - Change in VaR\n= $113,110 - ($113,110 * -14.86%)\n= $113,110 - $16,895.31\n= $96,214.69\n\nSo, the new VaR when volatility changes by -9.67% is approximately $96,214.69.", "model": "mathstral_7b", "recall": 0.0, "precision": 0.0, "final_answer_match": 0}
