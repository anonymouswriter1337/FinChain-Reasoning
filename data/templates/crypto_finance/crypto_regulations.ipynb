      "  • Regulatory: Civil penalties up to $$1,112,076 per violation (OFAC 2023 maximum)\n",
      "  • Criminal: Potential criminal charges for willful violations (up to 30 years imprisonment, $10M+ in fines)\n",
      "  • Business: Loss of banking relationships, payment processor terminations\n",
      "  • Reputational: Public enforcement actions, loss of customer trust\n",
      "  • Operational: Potential for license revocation or business restrictions\n",
      "\n",
      "Conclusion:\n",
      "  For a cryptocurrency exchange dealing with potential Iran sanctions exposure, immediate action is essential. The response must balance containment, reporting obligations, and remediation. Given Iran's Sanctions evasion, terrorism financing and Bitcoin mining for foreign currency acquisition, regulators will expect comprehensive action and documentation. The strict liability nature of most sanctions regimes means that even unwitting violations can result in significant penalties, making rapid response and thorough documentation critical to demonstrating compliance commitment.\n",
