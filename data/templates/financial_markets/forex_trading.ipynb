      " Brad Johnson wants to convert $724.43 to Japanese yen. The current USD/JPY exchange rate is 140.51 (meaning 1 USD = 140.51 JPY). How many JPY will Brad Johnson receive?\n",
      "\n",
      "Solution:\n",
      " Step 1: Multiply the amount in USD by the USD/JPY rate:\n",
      "  $724.43 × 140.51 = ¥101789.66\n",
