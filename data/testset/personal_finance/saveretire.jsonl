They aim to have $26928497 at retirement in 28 years. Assuming an annual investment return of 4.82%, how much additional money will they need to save each year to meet their retirement goal?", "solution": "Step 1: Calculate the future value of current savings with investment returns:\n  Future Value of Current Savings = $524515 \u00d7 (1 + 4.82%)^28 = $1959721.07\n\nStep 2: Calculate the future value of current annual savings:\n  Future Value of Annual Savings = $457194 \u00d7 [((1 + 4.82%)^28 - 1) / 4.82%] = $25954330.77\n\nStep 3: Calculate total projected savings at retirement:\n  Total Projected Savings = $1959721.07 + $25954330.77 = $27914051.84\n\nStep 4: Calculate the shortfall between the target and projected savings:\n  Shortfall = $26928497 - $27914051.84 = $-985554.84\n\nStep 5: Since the projected savings ($27914051.84) exceeds the target savings ($26928497),\n  no additional savings are required.

They currently have $949738 saved and expect to save $159068 per year until retirement. Assuming an average annual return of 4.67% on their investments before retirement and 3.50% during retirement, how much will they have at retirement, and will it be enough if they want to withdraw $937096 per year for the rest of their life (assumed life expectancy of 76 years)?", "solution": "Step 1: Calculate the future value of current savings:\n  Future Value (Current Savings) = $949738 \u00d7 (1 + 4.67%)^27 = $3256895.82\n\nStep 2: Calculate the future value of additional annual savings:\n  Future Value (Additional Savings) = $159068 \u00d7 [(1 + 4.67%)^27 - 1] / 4.67% = $8274455.59\n\nStep 3: Calculate the total savings at retirement:\n  Total Savings at Retirement = $3256895.82 + $8274455.59 = $11531351.41\n\nStep 4: Calculate the capital needed to sustain annual withdrawals of $937096 for 17 years:\n  Using the present value of an annuity formula:\n  Capital Needed = Annual Withdrawal \u00d7 [1 - (1 + r)^-n] / r\n                 = $937096 \u00d7 [1 - (1 + 3.50%)^-17] / 3.50%\n                 = $11855501.92\n\nStep 5: Determine if there's a shortfall or surplus:\n  Shortfall/Surplus = $11531351.41 - $11855501.92 = $-324150.51\n\nThe retirement plan is not feasible as currently structured.
