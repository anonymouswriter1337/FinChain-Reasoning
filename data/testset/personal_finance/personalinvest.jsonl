How will this diversification likely impact their overall portfolio risk?", "solution": "Step 1: Calculate the total existing portfolio investment:\n  Total Existing Investment = $2982474 + $2440905 + $4690640 = $10114019.00\n\nStep 2: Calculate the total investment after diversification:\n  Total Investment with New Asset = $10114019 + $875281 = $10989300.00\n\nStep 3: Assess the impact of correlation on portfolio risk:\n  Diversification helps reduce risk by investing in assets that don\u2019t move in the same direction. Correlation values range from -1 to +1, with:\n  - A negative correlation (closer to -0.5) reducing risk significantly, as the new asset tends to perform well when existing investments decline.\n  - A correlation near zero indicating that the new asset moves independently, offering some diversification benefits.\n  - A high positive correlation (closer to +0.5) suggesting an increase in risk, as the new asset moves similarly to the existing portfolio."}
