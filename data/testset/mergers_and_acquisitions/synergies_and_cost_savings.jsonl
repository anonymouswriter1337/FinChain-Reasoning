The combined operating expenses total $288 million, and the merger is projected to achieve a cost synergy of 13% on these expenses. In addition, revenue synergies are expected to add an extra $41 million annually. However, the merger incurs restructuring costs of $93 million, amortized over 5 years. Given an effective tax rate of 23%, calculate the net annual synergy savings after accounting for integration costs and tax adjustments.", "solution": "Step 1: Calculate cost synergy savings:\n         Cost Synergy = Operating Expense \u00d7 (Synergy Percentage / 100)\n                      = 288 \u00d7 (13 / 100) = 37.44 million\n\nStep 2: Identify the revenue synergy bonus:\n         Revenue Synergy = 41 million\n\nStep 3: Compute total synergy savings before integration costs:\n         Total Synergy = Cost Synergy + Revenue Synergy = 37.44 + 41 = 78.44 million\n\nStep 4: Determine the annual restructuring cost:\n         Annual Restructuring Cost = Restructuring Cost / Amortization Years\n                                = 93 / 5 = 18.6 million\n\nStep 5: Compute preliminary net savings (before tax adjustment):\n         Preliminary Net Savings = Total Synergy - Annual Restructuring Cost = 78.44 - 18.6 = 59.84 million\n\nStep 6: Adjust for tax impact:\n         Net Annual Savings = Preliminary Net Savings \u00d7 (1 - Tax Rate / 100)\n                           = 59.84 \u00d7 (1 - 23 / 100) = 46.08 million\n\nThus, the net annual synergy savings after tax adjustments is 46.08 million dollars."}

Tesla has an annual operating cost base of $109 million, and Berkshire Hathaway has $179 million. It is expected that redundant operations will be eliminated, achieving a cost saving of 10% on the combined cost base. Calculate the annual cost savings from the merger.", "solution": "Step 1: Compute the total cost base:\n         Total Cost = 109 + 179 = 288 million\n\nStep 2: Compute the cost savings:\n         Savings = Total Cost \u00d7 (Synergy Percentage / 100)\n                 = 288 \u00d7 (10 / 100) = 28.8 million\nHence, the annual cost savings from the merger is 28.8 million dollars."}

Microsoft and Facebook have variable operating expenses of $112 million and $220 million respectively. The merger is expected to reduce these expenses by 15% due to operational improvements. However, an integration cost of $44 million is incurred, amortized over 5 years. Calculate the net annual savings from the merger.", "solution": "Step 1: Compute the total operating expenses:\n         Total Expenses = 112 + 220 = 332 million\n\nStep 2: Calculate the synergy savings:\n         Synergy Savings = Total Expenses \u00d7 (15 / 100) = 332 \u00d7 0.15 = 49.8 million\n\nStep 3: Compute the annual integration cost:\n         Annual Integration Cost = Integration Cost / Amortization Years = 44 / 5 = 8.8 million\n\nStep 4: Determine net annual savings:\n         Net Savings = Synergy Savings - Annual Integration Cost = 49.8 - 8.8 = 41.0 million\nTherefore, the net annual savings from the merger is 41.0 million dollars."}
